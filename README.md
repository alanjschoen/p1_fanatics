Project Benson for Metis (team 5)

##Problem Statement:

We will combine turnstile data with the locations of technology companies and higher educational institutions in order to target technology workers and students.  We will further refine the targeting to particular metro exits at particular times of day using turnstile data to optimize outreach ahead of the Summer 2017 gala.
